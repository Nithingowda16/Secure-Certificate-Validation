# Secure Access Control & Validation of Certificate using Blockchain and Python


Secure Access Control & Validation of Certificate using Blockchain and Python
Overview
This project implements a secure access control and certificate validation system using Blockchain and Python. The system ensures tamper-proof certificate issuance, validation, and verification while providing secure access to authorized users.

Features
Blockchain-based Certificate Storage – Prevents forgery and unauthorized modifications.
Secure Access Control – Implements authentication & role-based authorization.
Certificate Issuance & Validation – Ensures legitimacy and ownership of certificates.
SQL Database Integration – Stores user credentials and metadata securely.
Web Interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) – User-friendly UI for certificate verification.
Tech Stack
Backend: Python (Flask/Django), Blockchain (Ethereum/Hyperledger)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL
Smart Contracts: Solidity (if using Ethereum)
