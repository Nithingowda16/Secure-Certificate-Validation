# Secure Access Control & Validation of Certificate using Blockchain and Python

Overview
This project leverages Blockchain technology, Python, SQL, and HTML to create a secure and efficient system for certificate validation and access control. By combining the immutability of blockchain with the versatility of Python and SQL, this system ensures that certificates are tamper-proof and easily verifiable.

Features
Blockchain Integration: Certificates are stored on a blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency.

Access Control: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions for certificate issuance and validation.

SQL Database: Efficient storage and retrieval of metadata related to certificates.

Web Interface: User-friendly interface built with HTML for interaction with the system.

Technologies Used
Blockchain: For storing and validating certificates.

Python: Backend logic and integration with blockchain.

SQL: Database for metadata storage.

HTML: Frontend for user interaction.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Secure-Certificate-Validation.git
cd Secure-Certificate-Validation
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the SQL database:

Create a database and configure the connection in config.py.

Run the migration script:

bash
python migrate.py
Deploy the blockchain smart contract:

Use a blockchain platform like Ethereum.

Deploy the contract and update the contract address in config.py.

Usage
Start the server:

bash
python app.py
Access the web interface at http://localhost:5000.

Use the dashboard to issue, validate, and manage certificates.
